                <h2>A Brief History</h2>
                <p>
                    The origins of stinky tofu are somewhat unclear, but it is widely believed to have been introduced during the Qing Dynasty. The fermented tofu was initially made by rural families using traditional methods to preserve tofu in a brine solution. The smell was a natural result of the fermentation process. Over time, this humble dish became a staple in night markets and street food stalls across Taiwan, evolving into the beloved snack it is today.

                <h2>How is Stinky Tofu Made?</h2>
                <p>
                    Stinky tofu is made from a block of tofu that is soaked in a fermentation brine made from vegetables, meat, and sometimes even shrimp or fish. The tofu is left to ferment for days or even weeks, developing its signature odor. Once ready, the tofu is deep-fried until the outside is crispy and golden brown, while the inside remains soft and creamy.
